The scripting language used in piXXelgamer is used for 2 purposes:

 - Automate the creation process
 - Scripting the elements in the game

The language is Pascal like and easy to learn. You don't have to use scripts at all, but with them you can
create your prototype much faster and also use some functions otherwise not available.
