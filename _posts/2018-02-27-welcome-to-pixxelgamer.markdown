## piXXelgamer

piXXelgamer is a macOS (Minimum 10.12 required) based tool to create in a easy way prototypes of 3D games.
It will be available in three different versions. The first one is used for 3D Games.

### Introduction

Like many game developers i have also a big list of game ideas and most of time i have take XCode and started
programming. Many times it was obvious after, that the idea or the main gameplay is not as good as i thought first
or at least needs some modification. I was often thinking it would be cool to have a tool to simply the creation of ideas.

The other reason to build piXXelgamer was the fact, that i'm not very good in game art and so it would be cool have a helping
tool which can support me on this. The tool allows to use different model sets (called libraries) and mix them also together.
It even allows to use primitives like cube's etc. to include them also in the game.

### Current state

The current version allows to create an entire level and based on that also already a simple implementation using physics
and/or scripts.


### Missed features

- Documentation: This **main** feature is completely missing for now. It will allow to create a PDF document to describe the entire project.
- Collision: The core is already implemented but currently just usable by write event scripts. I want a rule editor instead.
- Physics: The core is already implemented but currently just usable by write event scripts. I want a rule editor instead.
- Sound: Feature not available.
- User Interface: Feature not available.
- AI: Feature not available.
- Scripting: 80% is already implemented and works. Must be more stable and faster also. Also future versions will have a script catalog to easy access written scripts
- Score system: A scriptable scoring system which allows to implemet easy loose/win situations, points and life.

### Known issues

- Scripting: Variable handling is too limited
- Camera handling: Is still flickering between
- General bugs: The software is quite stable but still has some unhandled crashes
